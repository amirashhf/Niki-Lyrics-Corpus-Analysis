Gazin' out the windows of the bus
Watchin' Maryland pass by
There was sky, and where there wasn't
There was the thought of us
Maryland passed, and so did I

Soft like wax, sharp as an axe
Both can't be true in my world
New indentations cover my back
Goddamn it, I'm at least somebody's strong girl
Mm, aren't I?

You surprised me on the road I didn't catch
Your distinct footfalls up the stage
I'll admit that made the tour less of a drag
And like a child or a fool, I hoped you'd stay

Revolving doors spit me out onto the street
Sling my bags over my shoulder and cry
Press my belly, pull the tab
And just maybe I'll flash

My teeth, the ache's the best index for
Drive, in my mother's words
"Just drag your heels and don't you draw a line
Be strong, girl"
Strong girl

It's to the death
Or less than nothing, I'm a
Pendulum, I don't know where I'll land
I just know that I can swing it, I'll always swing it

'Cause Goddamn it, fuck if I'm not everybody's
Strong girl, mm
Ah, strong girl
Who am I if I can't be everybody's strong girl? (Strong girl)
Strong girl (Strong girl)
Aren't I?
