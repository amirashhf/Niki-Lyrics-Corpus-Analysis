A roaring tsunami
You came crashing in like an act of God
Shake my earth, suck the air out, burn me down
It's like you've known me through all my past lives
What an evil thought
Wreck my plans, stop me dead, kiss me now

Hand on my leg
Chokehold on my head
I wanna be wherever you are
Wanna get carried away
Want wave after wave 'cause

I'm going under
Storm, lightning, thunder
I'm drowning in the deepest of truths
Fuck, I think I'm falling for you

You spoke and the wind changed the very first day
Right away, I knew
It was over, you exist now, to my doom
And I swore I wouldn't curl up in the palm of your hand
Oh no, I refuse
There's nothing I can do

I asked you at the beach
Swan dove headfirst into the blue
Was this a crazy reach?
And the rest is glorious history, ain't it now? 'Cause

I'm going under
Storm, lightning, thunder
I'm drowning in the deepest of truths
Fuck, I think I'm falling for you
I'm tired of playing pretend
I wanna jump right off the deep end
Sink into the God-honest truth
Fuck, I think I'm falling for you

(I'm going under)
Fuck, I think I'm falling for you
Oh, I think I'm falling for you
Fuck, I think I'm falling for you
