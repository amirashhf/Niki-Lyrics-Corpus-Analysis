I carved my name into your ribcage
We talked of lands away from this cage
You said, don't fret love, someday I'll be my own man, I'll be free
Oh, but darling, did you mean
Darling, did you mean free from me?

You promised home
The kind I'd never known, oh
But here we are, skin and flesh and beating hearts
And I'm wondering what the hell I'm doing wrong
You said, "Let's make ourselves our very own brigade, this love our shield, our blade"
Oh, but darling do you see the cuts from which I bleed?
It's me you've slain

I didn't obliterate these walls for you to come and raid my home
And here you are right next to me
Ironically, I've never felt more alone

I fell for you faster than I fell apart
And I guess I'm the one to blame for letting myself fall too hard
I ripped my heart out and put it in your hands in hopes that we'd put up a fight
How paradoxical, since now all I can think about is when will we stop trying
Oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh, how do we stay afloat?
When do I let go?

All you do is blindside me, it's hard to be brave
But when the night cuts into the day, it's your love I crave
I must've thanked my lucky stars too much
They left me sitting in too much dust

You know all my dreams
You were one, so it seemed
And I love you but with you
It's heartache I breathe
You gave it your all, just with everything you took from me

Oh, my love
Is this the end for us?
Maybe we've had enough
