You take Sherman Oaks
Your backyard citrus grove
Find your zest for life again

I'll take this corner gladly
Of the San Fernando Valley
As we take turns seeing all our friends

So you take your walks
And I'll take the dog
On a drive somewhere
And you take care

You take someone's clothes off
And someone takes me home
When bitterness bites, novelty is nectar

Take the craftsman picks
And I'll start taking risks
And take my word for it, knowing you made me better

So you take it easy
And I'll take my time
It's only fair
You take the cake
For a love so rare
So you take care
