Take it from the wolves
To make it out the woods together is an art
We couldn't do such a thing
We were too afraid of the dark

So you drove far, far, far away
From the life we built
Brick by brick just until
We were swept up in the cruelest cyclone
Oh, my eyes were glued to yours
As we chose to ignore
The rattling floorboards
Now I'm sleeping alone

Four full laps around the sun
We wouldn't admit that we were done
Now I may very well have just lost the one
(I may very well have just lost the one)
I'm a January baby, you were born in June
An ice-cold bitch when you burn like noon
Was it hidden in the cards that I'd lose you?
Was it written in the stars that we'd meet a little too soon?

Just a little too soon
On the wrong blue moon
The wrong blue moon
Just a little too soon

You are good
It's that very goodness that antagonizes me
How could I ever measure up?
It took being written out the novel to finally see
That you care more about

Being good than being good to me
And, yes, the difference may be subtle
But it woulda saved us, baby
Oh, I've never been worried
'Bout getting my hands dirty
But you wash yours of any ownership
In the mess we made

Four full laps around the sun
We wouldn't admit that we were done
Now I may very well have just lost the one
(I may very well have just lost the one)
I'm a January baby, you were born in June
An ice-cold bitch when you burn like noon
Was it hidden in the cards that I'd lose you?
Was it written in the stars that we'd meet a little too soon?

Just a little too soon
On the wrong blue moon
The wrong blue moon

And I know it's not every day you meet somebody like you
It's once in the bluest moon, the love we had and still do
Maybe I'll give you a call when I turn thirty-two
And you'll say, "Who knew?

The four full laps around the sun
Once upon a time when we were young
You were really always gonna be the one"
(I hope that you're always gonna be the one)
I'm a January baby, you were born in June
An ice-cold bitch when you burn like noon
Was it hidden in the cards that I'd lose you?
Was it written in the stars that we'd meet a little too soon?

Just a little too soon
On the wrong blue moon
The wrong blue moon
Just a little too soon

A little too soon
It would've been you
