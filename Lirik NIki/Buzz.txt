It's the anticipation when the amps turn on
Just cables and crackle
It's the first flicker of the neon sign
It's the words stuck in your Adam's apple

It's a hand on the handle of the front door
It's making eyes in the middle of the dance floor
I feel like hot shit, wanna make out
In your car in the lot of a drug store
It's a bumblebee on a blossom
The first coffee shop run in Autumn
It's that feeling, a propeller
The first line of a fucking bestseller

The song's about to start (Can you hear it?)
The door's about to open (Can you feel it?)
The flower's about to fruit (Can you see it?)
I'm about to fall for you

About to fall for you

It's the accidental touch when you don't mean to
The thickest tension
It's the millisecond freeze frame after good news
Or an unexpected mention

It's the big long bow before the show ends
The phone toss when it's risky and you hit send
It's feeling dizzy when you're tipsy
Wondering why you're so nervous 'round a so-called "friend"
It's goosebumps when you hear the drums
The running start before the big jump
It's that feeling, so stellar
Bro, if you like her, just go and fucking tell her

The song's about to start (Can you hear it?)
The door's about to open (Can you feel it?)
The flower's about to fruit (Can you see it?)
I'm about to fall for you
The song's about to start (Can you hear it?)
The door's about to open (Can you feel it?)
The flower's about to fruit (Can you see it?)
I'm about to fall for you

About to fall for you
About to fall for you
