I wanna be an itch you can't scratch
I don't need to know where you're at
You put on a show when there's nothing else to say
I only know, 'cause I'm the same way

And I've kept you at an arm's length
But now my shoulder's sore
It's out of my hands to wanna feel yours

Like some kind of magnet
You're a mystic force
I try to explain away through planets, of course
But it's no use, there's no rhyme or reason
Each time I push the thoughts away, you're pulling me in
Again and again and again

The air buzzes whenever you're near
Are you the one, or are you just a mirror?
Either way, you have me at my wit's end
Guess what I'm trying to say is
I'd rather die than be friends

Can't you feel the steady thrum
When you and I are side-by-side?
It's electric when our fingers brush
Quit acting like

We're not two magnets
A mystic force
I try to explain away through planets, of course
But it's no use, there's no rhyme or reason
Each time I push the thoughts away, you keep pulling me in
Again and again and again
I don't wanna be your friend
I couldn't care less if this ends, in the end
