So you wanna talk
You can do so to my moisturized hand
I swear to God
This is your last year to understand
No, you don't get to drop my name
I loved you like family what a bug fat shame

And yeah, I'm gonna play (Play) the shit (Shit) out of the blame game
I actually think it's criminally underrated
Burn a bridge, build your resume, nice trade
And yet you're still a jack of none

I hope that it was worth it
Do I think you deserve this?
My answer doesn't matter
'Cause you and I (You and I), we don't talk (We don't talk)
To my benefit and your colossal loss

Is this what the kids call petty?
Well, I'm happy to report that petty feels pretty awesome
Now your heart feels heavy
What happened to making a light of every problem?
And now you expect me
To wanna get brunch, no, thanks
But someone more important might
I don't know, it's just a hunch

I hope that it was worth it
Do I think you deserve this?
My answer doesn't matter
'Cause you and I (You and I), we don't talk (We don't talk)
To my benefit and your colossal loss

To my sadness and your sadder colossal loss
You should've seen that this would be your colossal loss
