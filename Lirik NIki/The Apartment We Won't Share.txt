The apartment we won't share
I wonder what sad wife lives there
Have the windows deciphered her stares?
Do the bricks in the walls know to hide the affairs?

The dog we won't have is now one I would not choose
The daughter we won't raise still waits for you
The girl I won't be is the one that's yours
I hope you shortly find what you long for

Two years and some change
Isn't it strange?
You're a full-fledged socialist
I go by a new name

The filthy joke that won't
Burrow in the corner of your
Smirking lips, I mourn it to this day

The story we won't tell
Is my greatest fantasy
The passion I won't feel again
Isn't lost on me

The son you never wanted
Is the wound your father left
And the mother I won't be is
Probably for the best

Your demons I won't meet
Now someone else's word to keep
I'm sure she's beautiful and sweet
Not what I wanted, but what we need
