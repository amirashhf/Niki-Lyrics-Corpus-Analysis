Morning seeps through the blinds
And joins us in bed
And you stir in your sleep
There goes fear embedding

What if I make you pancakes
But you choose to skip breakfast?
What if when you're fully awake
You come to your senses

Hours pass on the hood of your car
So little is said
I wait for your arms
But you give your jacket instead

Am I at your disposal?
You tell me I'm nice
But I know I'm only the hostel
Till there's a house that you like

It hasn't been long since the first kiss goodnight
Said I stole your heart, you called me a thief
This love's but a newborn, so why does it bite?
It hasn't even lost all its milk teeth
So why are you already anxious to leave?

I know soon enough we'll come apart at the seams
But just one empty kiss and it's not as bad as it seems
We breathe for different reasons, both as petty, I'd reckon
You for your "Well done's," and me for "You're welcome"

It hasn't been long since the first kiss goodnight
Said I stole your heart, you called me a thief
This love's but a newborn, so why does it bite?
It hasn't even lost all its milk teeth
So why are you already anxious to leave?

So why are you already anxious to leave?
