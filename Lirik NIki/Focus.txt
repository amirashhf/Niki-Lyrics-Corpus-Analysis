You're a complicated puzzle
I so badly wanna piece together
To justify my mental strife
Could the big picture maybe muffle
All the sirens going off
And then my friends can't say they were right

No, guys, I swear he's not emotionally unavailable
He's just traumatized
No, guys, I swear he's not a lost cause
It's just he hasn't met the girl that'll fix his life (But who am I kidding?)
Your eyes ever-shifting
Something's always missing
Why can't you look at what's in front of you?

Focus for once
What is it that you want?
You'd probably burst into flames
If you ask yourself that I
Shouldn't stick around
You got a girl that's a friend in every town
Who's the cliché, who's the clown?
Which one's me, which one's you?
Either way it's true
Wish you'd focus on what's in front of you right now

Wish you'd focus on what's in front of you right now

Don't talk to me about your last date
I'm seething through my smile
I hope she stubs her toe next time she texts
Her name is probably Cecilia
She shops at Aritzia
And has your lips all over her neck

What are the odds that you actually like me, and not just the chase?
Probably embarrassingly low
Are you the exception or do I just like your music taste?
I can't tell, I don't know
What's important to you (God knows)
I keep lookin' for clues (Oh, no!)
Be a big boy and face the fucking truth

Focus for once
What is it that you want?
You'd probably burst into flames
If you ask yourself that I
Shouldn't stick around
You got a girl that's a friend in every town
Who's the cliché, who's the clown?
Which one's me, which one's you?
Either way it's true
Wish you'd focus on what's in front of you right now

Wish you'd focus on what's in front of you

(Focus for once)
(You know what you want)
