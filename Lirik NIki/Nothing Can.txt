You go to someone's afters thing
An hour in and the floor's disgusting
Then the room is a sailboat in a storm
And a new friend's a soaring kite
And you blink, and there goes another night
You call your sweetie when you can
A minute in and it's bitter again
And what's unsaid feel like concrete slabs
Hailing down from the sky so fast
So you hang up, and you're not sure if you wanna cry or laugh

And you look around your bedroom
You're all alone again
No one will ever save you
No one and nothing can
But you still smile at a stranger
And you still make your weekend plans
No one will ever save you
No one and nothing can
No one and nothing can

We're hostages to the hour and the minute hands
Working overtime just to freeze them
'Cause sitting alone with yourself is burning alive
So you blast the speakers on the drive
Never knowing if the notes will either douse or fan the fire

Now I'm pacing around my dressing room
Looking in the mirror alone again
No one will ever save you, girl
No one and nothing can
But you'll still write another song
And you'll still get breakfast with the band
No one will ever save you, girl
No one and nothing can
No one and nothing can
No one and nothing can
No one and nothing can
