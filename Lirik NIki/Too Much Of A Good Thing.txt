Well, you look like you're gonna break my heart
And I look like a tough shot in the dark on a good day
Intentions clear and stronger than the noon sky
You're the bee's knees, I'm the bull's eye but in a doomed way

You can do your own thing, look, the choice is yours
But I can't help that I'm the thing you're looking for

We could be too much of a good thing
But isn't that a real good thing?
Oh baby, look me in the eye and say you don't got it bad
Maybe it won't be a sure thing
But it sure is a good thing
I get the feeling that this feeling isn't one meant to last anyway

So what do you say?
So what do you say?

You show off your true nature on your earlobe
Serpentine, you're a walking, breathing trope in a fun way
Not to jinx it, but I wanna be the reason
Your future lovers keep changing with the seasons babe

Something tells me this is gonna hurt someday
But I don't believe in mistakes
I know that's convenient to say

You have too much of a good thing
But isn't that a real good thing?
Oh baby, say it with your hands and we can talk all night long
Maybe it won't be a sure thing
But it sure is a good thing
I get the feeling that you're something that will surely go wrong
But never away

So what do you say?
What do you say?
