If God really listens
Like your mom says he does
Then he better be saving you
For our future kids and dogs

I thought we'd be married
Two pillars firm and proud
But real love is a verb
I get it now

My youth is in your past
You'll always have that
And though it didn't last
I hope our paths cross again

If time heals all
It's a lousy doctor
Or a half-baked thought
'Cause I still can't block you

I came upon family
And thought I was stifled
Thought my freedom endangered
I was just young and entitled

And you taught me a lot
Stretched and wrung and tossed
I'm sorry we got lost
I hope our paths cross again

We'll love others
We'll drift apart
But every time I sing a song
You won't feel very far

The future's ours to write
The songs, the scars, the life
I'll catch up with you some other time
When our paths cross again
Cross again
