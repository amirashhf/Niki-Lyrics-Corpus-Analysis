Build a pillow barricade so the ghosts can't get to me
Twenty-something instincts feel like a deadbeat dad
Never there when it counts and puts you right in therapy
Life is a gamble, baby, and you'll have to live with that

Oh, but I'll be fine cause I always end up
Just fine, then I'll call a friend up
That's just how it is

And I'll wake up tired and vaguely sore
Stir a pot when I'm feeling bored
Full-sending a lot, only halfway sure
Walking around with heirloom pain
Dad's temper and Mom's mistakes
I'm always afraid to fall flat on my face
But doing it anyway

Doing it anyway

Walls up to the skies
Many men have marched around to no avail
There's Achilles, and there's
His God-forsaken heel

I do the dishes and tend the garden
Soften up where I used to harden
And take a moonlit walk

And I'll wake up tired and vaguely sore
Stir a pot when I'm feeling bored
Full-sending a lot, only half is sure, oh
Walking around with heirloom pain
Grandma left but her heartache stayed
Now I'm always afraid to take up space
Yet doing it anyway

Doing it anyway, oh

People fall in love and fuck up
And have kids who fall in love and fuck up
Who have kids that fall in love and have you
People fall in love and fuck up
We all fall in love and fuck up
You will fall in love and fuck up too
